# Real-Time Face Recognition System

This repository contains a Flask-based web application for real-time face recognition using OpenCV. The application captures video feed from the camera and detects faces in real time, recognizing them if they match pre-trained faces. Recognized faces are then displayed with labels on the video stream. The application also provides a dashboard to manage user records.

## Features

- Real-time face detection and recognition.
- Dynamic display of recognized faces with labels.
- Dashboard to manage and view user records.
- Face recognition using the LBPH (Local Binary Pattern Histograms) algorithm.
- SQLite database integration to store user records.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- Flask
- Pillow (PIL)
- SQLite
