# Smart-CCTV-Camera-using-RaspberryPi-Flask
A Smart CCTV camera using Raspberry Pi and OpenCV involves several key 
steps. First, it is necessary to install the Raspbian operating system on the Raspberry Pi board and 
ensure that it is properly connected to the internet. Next, OpenCV must be installed on the 
Raspberry Pi board. This can be achieved using a variety of methods, depending on the specific 
requirements of the project.
Once OpenCV is installed, the Smart CCTV camera can be programmed to perform advanced 
features such as facial recognition, object detection, and motion detection. This involves leveraging 
the capabilities of OpenCV to analyze the camera feed and detect relevant events or objects. 
Depending on the specific requirements of the project, additional hardware or software may be 
necessary to implement these features effectively.
Finally, the Smart CCTV camera can be connected to a monitor or other device to view the camera 
feed in real-time. This can be accomplished using a variety of methods, including connecting the 
Raspberry Pi board to a display via HDMI or using remote access software to view the camera 
feed on a separate device.
Overall, building a Smart CCTV camera using Raspberry Pi and OpenCV can be an effective way
to enhance security systems and implement advanced features without incurring the costs 
associated with more expensive hardware solutions
